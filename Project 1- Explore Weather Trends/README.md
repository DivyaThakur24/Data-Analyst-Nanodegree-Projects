# Explore Weather Trends

## Summary

In this project, I analyzed local and global temperature data and compared the temperature trends where I live "Egypt" to overall global temperature trends.


**Extracting the data from the database in Udacity workspace**
I've exported the temperature data for the world as well as for the closest big cities to where I live, I chose Cairo & Alexandria and to interact with the database I will use SQL.

**Creating a line chart**
The chart line compares Cairo & Alexandria temperatures with the global temperatures. then plotting the moving average rather than the yearly averages in order to smooth out the lines, making trends more observable.

**Making observations**
All included in the pdf file, the observations include the similarities and differences between the world averages, Cairo, and Alexandria averages, as well as overall trends. H
